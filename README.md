🎉 Fun Calculator
A simple and entertaining Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers with a fun, emoji-filled interface!
📋 Description
The Fun Calculator is a beginner-friendly Python script that takes two numbers as input and performs all four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's designed with a playful approach to make learning Python math operations more enjoyable.
✨ Features

Addition ➕: Adds two numbers together
Subtraction ➖: Subtracts the second number from the first
Multiplication ✖️: Multiplies two numbers
Division ➗: Divides the first number by the second
Decimal Support: Handles both integers and floating-point numbers
Fun Interface: Emoji-rich comments and output for an engaging experience

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed on your system
No additional libraries required (uses only built-in Python functions)

Installation

Clone this repository or download the script file
Save the code as fun_calculator.py
You're ready to go! 🎯

💻 Usage

Run the script in your terminal or Python environment:
bashpython fun_calculator.py

Enter the first number when prompted
Enter the second number when prompted
View all four arithmetic results instantly!

Example Run
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 15.0
Difference: 5.0
Product: 50.0
Quotient: 2.0
⚠️ Important Notes

Division by Zero: The current version doesn't handle division by zero. Entering 0 as the second number will cause a runtime error. Future versions will include error handling.
Input Validation: The script expects valid numeric input. Non-numeric input will cause an error.

🛠️ Future Enhancements

Add error handling for division by zero
Input validation for non-numeric entries
More mathematical operations (power, modulo, etc.)
Option to perform multiple calculations in one session
Menu-driven interface for operation selection
